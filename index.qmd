# Overview

In this session, I will delve into the (near) future of regulatory submissions, emphasizing three key advancements: full reproducibility, open-source technologies, and interactive data capabilities. I will explore how Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) practices and containerization are driving the evolution of regulatory submissions by ensuring that processes are fully reproducible and automated. Then I will describe how open-source technologies and R packages are transforming clinical reporting by providing robust, customizable solutions that enhance transparency and flexibility. Finally, I will showcase the power of interactive data capabilities using {teal} and Shiny, demonstrating how these tools facilitate dynamic data exploration and visualization. Through practical examples, I will showcase how integrating these innovations can streamline regulatory workflows, improve data management, and, hopefully, foster more informed decision-making in pharmaceutical research. Ideal for R developers, data scientists, and clinical researchers, this session will equip you with the knowledge to embrace these future-ready approaches in your own work.


## Learning objectives


## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you make adverse event tables or descriptive statistics tables in R? Or table shells for either?


The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. 
It will be assumed that participants can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%` operator is a plus, but not required.

## Prework

**THIS WILL BE ON POSIT CLOUD**
Before attending the workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R** 

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Most recent release of xxx and other packages used in workshop.

    ```r
    # install isntructions
    ```
-   Ensure you can knit R markdown documents
    - Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document
    - Save the document and check you are able to knit it.
