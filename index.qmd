# Overview

In this workshop, we will explore the future of regulatory submissions, focusing on three pivotal advancements: full reproducibility, open-source technologies, and interactive data capabilities. We‚Äôll examine how Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) and containerization are transforming submissions by enabling reproducible, automated processes. We‚Äôll then look at how open-source tools and R packages are reshaping clinical reporting, offering flexible, transparent solutions. Finally, we‚Äôll dive into interactive data tools like {teal} and Shiny, showcasing their role in dynamic data exploration and visualization. 

## Learning objectives

After a vision-filled motivational introduction, and through a succession of practical examples, this session will empower R developers, data scientists, and clinical researchers to adopt innovative, future-ready approaches.

## Is this course for me?

Ever wondered how clinical trials reporting may look in the future? Are you interested in learning about some of the latest tools and technologies transforming regulatory submissions? Do you want to explore the potential of R in clinical research? If you answered yes to any of these questions, this workshop is for you!

The workshop is not designed only for those who are masters in R. We will bring you along an intuitive path to produce reproducible (and interactive) reports.

## Prework
