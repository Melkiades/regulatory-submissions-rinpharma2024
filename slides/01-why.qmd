# Why change? From proprietary software to R

## Main task: _reporting clinical trials_

<br>
<br>
<br>

Purpose of regulatory submissions is to show efficacy and safety of new drugs.

. . .

<br>

- Deliver analysis reports, datasets, and software
- Health Authorities (HA) need to be able to reproduce key results


## Why migrate to R in Clinical Trials?
_Benefits for all_

<br>
<br>

::: incremental

* **Cost Efficiency:** R is free, reducing software costs.

* **Flexibility:** R offers greater customization and a vast package ecosystem.

* **Community Support and Collaboration:** R has a large, active community driving rapid innovation.

## Why migrating to R in Clinical Trials?
_What's in it for us_

<br>

::: incremental

* **Talent Pool:** Growing number of professionals trained in R.
* **Transparency:** Râ€™s open-source nature ensures full transparency and reproducibility.
* **Integration:** R easily integrates with modern data tools and platforms.
* **R is a transversal skill:** other business units may benefit from R programmers.
* **Scalability in complexity:** very novel methods can be readily applied to clinical trials growing in complexity.

## Findings and issues from FDA

<br>
<br>

1. Different versions (R and open-source changes fast!)
2. Different OS (Linux and Windows)
3. Interactive features and p-hacking

. . .

<br>

1.-2.  Docker or WebAssembly (Pilot 4)
3. Even if p-hacking is NOT technology dependent, the ease-of-use and tweaking binds interactive features to the exploratory world

**Reproducibility and validation** - CRAN and extensive CI/CD testing, precise documentation and versioning

<br>

. . .

**Open-source** -  Collaboration and transparency accelerates industry towards standardization due to a wider adoption (faster submissions?)

<br>

. . .

**Interactivity** - {teal} as exploratory tool, integrates standard TLF, enables novel findings, and fast reviewer responses
