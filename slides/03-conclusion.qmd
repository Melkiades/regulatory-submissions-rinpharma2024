# What do we expect?

**Short-Term Considerations:**

The migration process requires initial investment in terms of time, resources, and training. Existing workflows and scripts need to be rewritten or adapted, which can be a significant effort.

<br>

**Long-Term Benefits:**

The long-term benefits of migrating to R include cost savings, increased flexibility, access to a broader talent pool, and staying ahead in terms of technological advancements. If regulatory bodies continue to increase acceptance of R, the case for migration becomes even stronger.
